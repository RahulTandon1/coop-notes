### Week 1 (Jan 8th - Jan 12th)
- Learnt about `netcat` and `netstat` linux networking commands.
- Got OpenQKDNet running on the 2 Dells (both of which run Ubuntu).
We run OpenQKDNet and got alice and bob working. The end result looked something like this:

### Week 2 (Jan 15th - Jan 19th)

Assigned tasks:
- TLS handshake [https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl?tab=readme-ov-file#tls-demo](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl?tab=readme-ov-file#tls-demo)
- Open wireshark to understand the handshake
- https://github.com/Open-QKD-Network/openssl/blob/openqkdnetwork-clean/hybrid_key_exchange.md
- [https://github.com/Open-QKD-Network/openssl/blob/openqkdnetwork-clean/oqs-template/generate.yml](https://github.com/Open-QKD-Network/openssl/blob/openqkdnetwork-clean/oqs-template/generate.yml)
- to learn TLS 1.3: [https://tls13.xargs.org/](https://tls13.xargs.org/)

What I did:
- Tried doing a Cryptography 101 by running through the Practical Networking [Practical TLS youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIFyRwBY_4bTwRX__Zn4-letrtpSj1mzY)
- In order to understand KEMs I tried reading a bit of Real World Cryptography's chapter on Asymmetric Encryption & Hybrid encryption but it went over my head. Kaiduan gave me a clarifying diagram for how KEMs work.
- Learnt about GDB. Used it to debug through the main method of OpenSSL (compiled with liboqs). This was for demonstration purposes & getting familiar with GDB rather than solving an issue.
- Got introduced to the overall project & the NSERC alliance.
- Used wireshark

### Week 3 (Jan 22nd - Jan 26th)

**Assigned tasks**
- learn how openssl generates the name group and key share extension in the source code
	- https://github.com/Open-QKD-Network/openssl/blob/openqkdnetwork-clean/ssl/statem/extensions_clnt.c#L195: function `tls_construct_ctos_supported_groups`
	- https://github.com/Open-QKD-Network/openssl/blob/openqkdnetwork-clean/ssl/statem/extensions_clnt.c#L609: function `add_key_share`
- Understand how we modified the original OpenSSL implementation of the TLS key exchange in the OQS fork of OpenSSL

**Work I did**
- Learnt how to use OpenSSL from the [OpenSSL Cookbook](https://www.feistyduck.com/library/openssl-cookbook/online/). Earlier I was just copy-pasting commands from readmes. Here, I was trying to understand how to use OpenSSL & what interface it provides.
- Ran into a compiler error when compiling Open-QKD-Network fork of OpenSSL
- Got the OQS fork of OpenSSL to work. Used GDB to get a call stack for `tls_construct_ctos_supported_groups`. 
- Attended the first Act2Qrypt presentation.
- 

### Week 4 (Jan 29th - Feb 2nd)
**Work assigned**
**Triple Key Exchange**
- read openqkd.c code to understand what change I need to make
- test my change using the test program in the api directory
- then integrate with openQKDNetwork and OpenSSL/libOQS
	- build`libqkd.a`
	- then build OpenSSL statically
- Helpful link: [https://github.com/Open-QKD-Network/openvpn/blob/pqcrypto/openqkd.md](https://github.com/Open-QKD-Network/openvpn/blob/pqcrypto/openqkd.md)
- Read through this [OQKD-libOQS-SSL integration document](https://github.com/Open-QKD-Network/openssl/blob/openqkd/openqkd/oqkd-liboqs-ssl-integration.pdf)
- need to run: `apps/openssl s_client -groups p521_oqkd_kyber1024 -CAfile ./ecdsa_CA.crt` for the triple key exchange.

**Non Triple Key Exchange**
- get the bob and alice file transfer working with OpenQKDNetwork disable-spring-auth branch
> reflecting: I initially misunderstood that I was required to do the file transfer using the triple key exchange. Figuring out what I had to do was the tough part.

- read as much code of the [tls-kms-demo](https://github.com/Open-QKD-Network/qkd-net/tree/disable-spring-auth/applications/tls-kms-demo/src) as possible
- read a bit of [LSRPRouter.java]([https://github.com/Open-QKD-Network/qkd-net/blob/disable-spring-auth/qnl/key-routi[â€¦]ervice/src/main/java/com/uwaterloo/iqc/qnl/lsrp/LSRPRouter.java](https://github.com/Open-QKD-Network/qkd-net/blob/disable-spring-auth/qnl/key-routing-service/src/main/java/com/uwaterloo/iqc/qnl/lsrp/LSRPRouter.java#L164)) in order to understand what might've gone wrong with Karlo's OpenQKDNet installation.
- learn Java JSON reader API: `com.google.gson.Gson` and `com.google.gson.stream.JsonReader`.

- Tried following the instructions in [openqkd.md]([https://github.com/Open-QKD-Network/openvpn/blob/pqcrypto/openqkd.md](https://github.com/Open-QKD-Network/openvpn/blob/pqcrypto/openqkd.md)) given in the previous week. Ran into an issue when compiling `openqkd.c`. Kaiduan clarified which branches I need to be working on.
- Got a lot of clarifying instructions from Kaiduan for next week.

### Week 6 (Feb 12th - Feb 16th)
**Assigned work**
- [BasQuaNa webinar](https://www.qkdnetworkcanadauk.com/webinar)
- [Kaiduan's 2021 ETSI slide deck](https://github.com/Open-QKD-Network/openssl/blob/openqkd/openqkd/ETSI_QUANTUM2021_kaiduan-xie.pptx)
- (optional; for my curiosity): cqp-openqkd integration.pdf

**Work I did**
- I thought I got the sample chat app (s_client & s_server) to work using the triple key exchange on Monday night, but I found out in Wednesday's meeting that wasn't the case. OpenQKDNet wasn't being called at all.
- Tuesday: learnt how to use tcpdump; generated packet captures (pcap) of key exchange & inspected them in Wireshark. Wrote out an explanation (in slack messages) which explained the client & server key_shares. Wrote [a file]([https://gist.github.com/RahulTandon1/df63681158811d8318441c88cca861fa](https://gist.github.com/RahulTandon1/df63681158811d8318441c88cca861fa)) of the (somewhat incorrect) steps I followed. 
- Wednesday: Kaiduan linked me to [Issue 34's openqkd.c]([https://github.com/Open-QKD-Network/qkd-net/blob/issue-34/applications/api/openqkd.c](https://github.com/Open-QKD-Network/qkd-net/blob/issue-34/applications/api/openqkd.c))
- Thursday & Friday - travelled to Montreal. Tried getting the triple key exchange to work. Honestly didn't do a lot of work. Made up for it after coming back.
Met with Dr. Stebila in order to figure out what I'm required to do/present next week.

| Wednesday, 13th March | - Got a clarification on SAEs & KMEs behaviour (security-wise) from Dr. LÃ¼tkenhaus: all SAEs connected to a KME act nicely, so they won't attack each other.                                                                                                                                |
| Thursday, 14th March  | Reading the Preface of Netty in Action made me realize I should know multithreading in Java. Found a course on it.<br>Speed running through [Mosh's Advanced Java course](https://codewithmosh.com/p/ultimate-java-part-3) to get familiar with Multi threading & asynchronous programming. |
| Friday, 15th March    | Continuing the course.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

### Week 11 (March 18th - March 22nd)
Doing the course entails: watching the video, taking some notes, experimenting with some examples on my laptop to get my hands dirty.

| Sunday, 31st March<br>(making up for slow progress with the book) | Got some sample netty code from the book running on my laptop. This is different from the passive reading I had been doing before this. It's also different from directly running examples from the book's [github repo](https://github.com/normanmaurer/netty-in-action/). I got my hands dirty with `pom.xml`s. |

Realized I wasn't solving the right problem<br>- Had a call with Kaiduan which brought clarity about the problem I'm meant to solve. I think it might be a variation of the Two General's Problem.                                                    |

| Monday, April 8th     | - Did a cursory reading through the [Two General's Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Generals%27_Problem), and [TCP's wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol) to confirm that our problem might be impossible to solve perfectly.<br>- Used TCP's closing mechanism as inspiration to suggest a possible mechanism for us<br>- Filled the early parts of this document by going through Slack messages. |
| Tuesday, April 9th    | - Finished filling the incomplete parts of the Work Log before the weekly meeting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

### Week 15 (April 15th - April 19th)
Wednesday - sped through Netty in Action. Need to modify the encoding & decoding of QNL Requests & Responses. Also want to come up with a better dev workflow, instead of git push, git pull, recompile, run qkd-net, run sample app, check logs.

Task for tomorrow:
- speed run bytebuf section
- figure out how to mock a QNLREs/response and use it to test ChannelHandlers.

Thursday
- Took me like all day to read through the bytebuf section. In retrospect maybe this was unnecessary.
- Got started on writing a test for RequestDecoder. I think there might be a bug in the decoder. Got partway through a fix but got into errors related to how maven is configured.

### Week 16 (April 23rd - April 26th)

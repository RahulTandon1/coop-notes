Purpose:
- backtrack and know what got things to work.
- accountable to myself and my managers.
- possibly a future intern

**Tuesday, Jan 23rd**
- Got a backtrace of `tls_construct_ctos_supported_groups` from GDB. Made me realise that GDB is really useful. Finding this information via printfs would've taken me way longer.
- Started using openssl using the OpenSSL Cookbook as a guide.

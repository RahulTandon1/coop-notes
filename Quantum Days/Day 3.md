### Quantum-inspired causal inference
> by
- scope of getting realism in quantum stuff
	- they claim every correlation must be explained causally
	- 
- need to understand causation in quantum theory to bridge the gap between quantum theory and general relativity.
- The causal inference initiative at Perimeter Institute

### Quantum Waves: Communication, Sensing and Beyond
> By Ebrahim Karimi of UOttawa, [JCEP](https://extremephotonics.com/)
- application to QKD
- Something about RSA
- orbital angular momentum as a degree of freedom
- Application in High Dimensional Quantum Key Distribution
- d-dimensional BB84
- used adaptive optics for qkd
- other qkd protocols: Chau15, Singapore, MUB

Questions to ask for Quantum Networks
- which is the best type of quantum memory

Rainer's take: QKD + PSK + PQC.
Secure delegated quantum computing
- Satellites come in different sizes. Use a small cube-sat to iterate and then go bigger

for the end user: q. sensing might come sooner than q. computing.

Audience Question: How do we raise awareness of data-farming attacks among industries?

Question: putting the Bell state measurement in the cloud

### Quantum Functionality in 2D Materials
> by Adina Luican-Mayer

 - strong quantum interactions
 - Discrete energy levels in single atoms.
 - When we get to a long chain of atoms we get an energy band.
 - quantum 2D materials
 - think of material as twisting and sliding not just stacked
 - solving Hamiltonians gets intractable
 - quantum simulator/simulation using materials
 - moire patterns
 - electron band very flat -> "highly correlated"
- gated quantum dot, charge detection
- alliance PQS2D - programmable quantum simulators in 2D materials


### Building Deployable Quantum Sensors
> by Amir Safavi-Naeini

- Want to build a chip-sized Quantum Sensor.
- Why do Optical instead of Digital? Noise. 
- A lot of breakthroughs in material for quantum stuff is useful for their purposes.

### Quantum Materials Panel Session


### Standardisation
It's important. *Somehow* helps the economy. There are committees anybody (including students) can join.
### Retrocausality
> by Emily Adlam
- People don't like Non-locality in Quantum Mechanics.
- Proposed an alternative: retrocausality
	- Dynamical Retrocausality
		- Maudlin's objection applies to this.
	- All-at-once retrocausality
- speaker wants us to pursue retrocausality in of itself instead of pursuing it in search of locality.

### Quantum metrology 
> by Sisi Zhou

**quantum metrology as a topic**
related to quantum sensing
making measurements more accurate than classical techniques using quantum theory.
What measurements?

topics mentioned:
- heisenberg limit on estimation error
- standard quantum limit
- HNKS condition: hamiltonian not in Kraus (span) condition
- Sequential and parallel strategies
- unitary channel, noisy channel -> hamiltonian
- Pauli Z Hamiltonian
- QEC is necessary and important.

Phonon - discrete unit (aka "quantum") of vibrational mechanical energy. Imagine a wave of vibration travelling through a solid when the solid is visualized as a bunch of atoms connected by springs. Term from **condensed matter physics**.

Quantum dudes - Hermitian, Hamiltonian, Hilbert (space), Lagrangian, Pauli, Boson, Bell

Hamiltonian reformulated Newtonian mechanics

`hamiltonian of a system`
- what  *operator* corresponding to total energy of the system.
- it has a spectrum which is related to eigenvalues and tells me about possible outcomes upon measuring the system.
- 

`surface code`

`interferometer` 
- from interference of light
- we use an interference (merging) pattern of light to detect stuff
>  - interference as a phenomenon
> 	 - water analogy: if identical waves perfectly align, a new wave with sum of amplitudes if found. If they perfectly disalign then an empty wave is found. *Total constructive interference and destructive interference respectively*.
> 	 - in the case of light, amplitude of the wave relates to brightness of light.
- popular use case: LIGO used to detect gravitational waves.

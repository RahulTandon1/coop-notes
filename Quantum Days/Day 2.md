### Experimental progress in quantum error amplification
> by Youngseok Kim of IBM Quantum

- Pauli twirling
- 127Q device
- Zero-Noise Extrapolation 
	- https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide/zne.html
- clifford circuits (verifiable), brute-force simulable circuits (verifiable), non-clifford circuits. There's some intersection between the first 2.
- used tensor network to approximate the quantum states 
- isoTNS method, MPS ... contribution by UC Berkley folks. https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14337
- 
- Poorly Trotterized time evolution dynamics
- claim: they have evidence of non-fault tolerant quantum computing being useful -> helps approximate stuff.
- "local observable"
- classical approximation methods.
- Probabilistic Error Amplification 
- CNOT

### Hardware-efficient quantum computing using qudits
> by Prof Christine Muschik of UW and IQC

- something related to simulation


### Panel: Benchmarking Quantum Computers
> People: Sayonee Ray (IonQ), Artur Izmaylov ()


- 3 approaches: [Annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_annealing), [Super conducting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconducting_quantum_computing), gate based, topological, trapped-ion  // other circuit architectures
- multi-qubit gate. IBM and Anyon focussed on the fidelity of 2-qubit gate.
- 
- eigen phase estimation 
- [t-gates](https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/21580/why-do-we-care-about-the-number-of-t-gates-in-a-quantum-circuit)

benchmarking logical gates
benchmarking physical gate

audience q: **why is [randomized benchmarking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_benchmarking) an appropriate benchmark**?



> What benchmarks for classical computers do we use to choose a computer?
- time to convergence for AI



**Questions to ask**
- relevance of using hardware through the cloud if the performance metric is algorithm or use-case based.

### Quantum Networks talks by Dr. Oblak
- many channels:
- db/km unit for measuring loss
- short-distance direct transmissions. Applications
	- QKD

	- Entanglement distribution
- long-distance
	- direct fiber optic transmissions not feasible
	- free space transmission in vacuum. "Improve loss scaling"
	- limiting factors: finite detector size, 
	- Quantum Satellite links -> Micius Quantum Satellite
		- long term vision: QEY Sat (Canada-wide effort)
- medium distance(200 to 2000 KM)
	- direct still not feasible
	- quantum repeaters (BSM heralds entanglement)
		- quantum memory
- quantum
	- photon echo quantum memories
		- steps: input, absorption, controlled rephasing, re-emission
		- rare-earth atoms doped in solids
		- Ytterbium-doped yttrium-ortho-silicate (YSO)
	- AFC quantum memory
	- Echo suppression protocol
 
 Audience question: advantage of Molecular Lanthanide stuff

Steps in QKD:

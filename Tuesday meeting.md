### Questions for us to answer and get back
- For connecting n nodes, how many QKD black boxes do we need?


### our questions
- what's their bootstrap process and shut down process for key generation
- is there any synchronisation mechanism for keys: e.g. like the sequence number of 2 keys being the same ===> the keys are same. So we might need something like a sequence number from them.
- how can they send the key to our software?

### Task

- on both nodes: read the key from a real QKD hardware device that provides an ETSI API and save it into `.qkd/qnl/qll/keys`.

- Overall flow:

![illustration of key flow](./media/overall%20flow.png)

- Assume since A < B (alphabetically/lexicographically),

1. A calls **getKey**. Receives key.

2. A notifies B and gives it the key information.

3. B calls **getKey with key info** and gets the key.

4. A and B save the key to file. We needs the files to be **synchronized** i.e. this step needs to be atomic i.e. only of the 2 should happen:

- Both of them save the key to file

- None of them save the key to file

> Clarification: We are not responsible for ensuring the content of the files is the same; that is QKD's responsibility. We're responsible for ensuring the file getting saved is atomic.

  

**Task #1**: Come up with a mechanism for site A to notify site B & send the key information.

  

**Task #2**: How the files are synchronized

  

### Revised Overall Flow

> Adapted from TCP's mechanism for [creating connections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol#Connection_establishment).

  

In a diagram:

![illustration of key flow](./media/revised%20flow.png)

In text:

1. A calls **getKey**. Receives key.

2. `SYN`: A sends to B `{ keyInfo, random number alpha }`.

3. B retrieves key by calling **getKey with key info**.

4. `SYN_ACK`: B sends to A `{ (alpha + 1), new random number beta}`

5. A does the following

- `ACK`: sends `{ beta+ 1 }` to B

- waits for `x=30 seconds` (we can experiment & change this value)

- saves key to file

6. Upon receivng the `ACK`, B saves the key to file.s

- Have small commits.

1. Configuration

2. Change QNL request encoder and decoder

3. Make request to mock server

---
**QNL quick dive**
- KeyServerRouterInit adds:
	- RequestDecoderV2
	- Logging handler
	- KeyRouterFrontendHandler
